# move-to_channel

usage: /move-<channel> ...@usernames

You will need a bot token to run this.

this bot moves all the mentioned users to a specific channel and creates one first if it doesnt exist

(rtc channel = any voice channel with a name that includes 'rtc' as a separate word)

if no users are mentioned it moves yourself

if you mention the bot it moves everyone in your voice channel
